<h2>Batch Jobs</h2>
<p>Batch Jobs are a mechanism for setting up a sequence of experiments to run
consecutively.  Each batch is self contained, containing all the references
needed to load files and process them into destination files without the need of
human intervention.  To aid in the process of creating and managing batch files,
there are a number of commands under "Batches" in the menu bar
