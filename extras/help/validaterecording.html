<h2>Validate Recordings</h2>
From the Recordings menu is a checkbox for validating Recordings.  If this checkbox is
selected then all recordings that are added are first completely loaded into memory in 
order to verify that the recording is a valid recording file.  Deselecting this box will
save time and memory when the recording is first loaded but may result in bad recordings 
being discovered in the middle of analysis.
