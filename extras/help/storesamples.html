<h2><a name="samples">Storing Samples</a></h2>
From the Recordings menu there is a checkbox for storing samples of recordings.  This
checkbox controls whether or not the samples referred to by the file are directly loaded
into memory or are left to reference by file.  Note that this feature has a similar effect
to the <a href="validaterecording.html">validate</a> checkbox except that the samples are 
retained after the file has been read.
