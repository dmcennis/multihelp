<h2>Editing a Recording</h2>
<p>
To edit a recording, select a file in the recordings table and select 
"Edit Recordings..." from the Recordings menu.  All changes are finalized if and 
only if the window is dismissed using the OK button.  Several different methods of
editing and viweing the file are presented.  
<p>
<h3>Changing the file format</h3>
The "Choose possible format" button allows one to select a sampling rate along 
with several other features.  These settings are not applied, however, until this
window is dismissed using the "ok" button and the "Change to Possible Format" 
button is clicked.  This can be undone with the "Restore" button

<h3>Applying Gain</h3>
<p>The "Apply Gain" button takes a float value from the text dialog box immediately 
to its right and interprets it as a double.  All samples in the file are multiplied 
by this value as soon as the "Gain" button is pressed. This can be undone with the 
"Restore" button.

<h3>Normalizing file</h3>
<p>This immediately scales the file such that the maximum value is 1.0 by applying
the appropriate gain.  This can be undone with the "Restore" button.

<h3>Mix Down to One Channel</h3>
<p>This mixes any stereo or higher recording into a mono recording. This can undone
with the "Restore" button.

<h3>Play</h3>
<p>This button plays the file to the default sound output device

<h3>Stop</h3>
<p>Stops any playback that may be taking place.

<h3>Restore</h3>
Restores the file to its original state.

<h3>View Samples</h3>
<p>This provides a mechanism for viewing all the samples of a recording. <b>Note</b>
This takes a very long time to produce for all but the shortest files.  The system 
is unresponsive in the meanwhile.

<h3>Plot Samples</h3>
<p>This provides a mechanism for viewing the samples in a graph.  <b>Note</b> This
takes a significant amount of time.  Large recordings will cause the system to 
appear to hang while preparing the display.

<h3>Plot Spectrum</h3>
<p>This provides a mechanism for viewing the harmonic spectrum of the entire recording.
<b>Note</b> This takes a significant amount of time to produce.  Large files will cause
the system to appear to hang while preparing the display.
