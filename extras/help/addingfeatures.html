<h2>Adding Features</h2>
<p>jAudio can insert additional features not in its base set using the features.xml file in the base directory.  Each entry
has its own XML descriptor describing it. For instance:</p>
<p></p>
<p><code>
	&lt;feature&gt;
		&lt;class&gt;jAudioFeatureExtractor.AudioFeatures.SpectralCentroid&lt;/class&gt;
		&lt;on/&gt;
	&lt;/feature&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The class must be the fully qualified class name.  The &lt;On&gt; tag specifies that the feature is on by default.  It can be omitted.
All other data is included in the <a href="">FeatureDefinition</a> in the feature and does not need to be specified again.</p>
<h2>Plugin Folder</h2>
<p>The plugin folder is defined at the start of the features.xml file. All classes inside are automatically loaded into jAudio on startup 
exactly as javac would compile a java file there.  i.e. jAudioFeatureExtgractor.DataModel would need to be placed in $plugin$/jAudioFeatureExtractor/DataModel.class 
where $plugin$ is the folder specified in the plugin XML entry.  The plugin folder must be a fully qualified URL (HTTP locations permitted) of the syntax:</p>
<p></p>
<p><code>
        &lt;pluginFolder&gt;file://Users/mcennis/jAudio/plugin&lt;/pluginFolder&gt;
</code></p>
