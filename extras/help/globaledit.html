<h2>Globally Editing all Feature Windows</h2>
When changing the sample rate, it is often desirable to keep the same length of
time for averaging windows such as mean and standard deviation.  The 
"Global Window Change" menu option allows changing all such windows at once.
The default window length is 100 windows.  The dialog box will only accept
positive integer window lengths.
