<h2>Adding New Aggregators</h2>
<p>jAudio can insert additional aggregators not in its base set using the features.xml file in the base directory.  Each aggregator
has its own XML descriptor describing it. For instance:</p>
<p></p>
<p><code>
	&lt;aggregator&gt;jAudioFeatureExtractor.Aggregators.AreaPolynomialApproximation&lt;/aggregator&gt;
</code></p>
<p>The class must be the fully qualified class name.  
All other data is included in the <a href="">AggregatorDefinition</a> in the aggregator and does not need to be specified again.</p>
<h2>Plugin Folder</h2>
<p>The plugin folder is defined at the start of the features.xml file. All classes inside are automatically loaded into jAudio on startup 
exactly as javac would compile a java file there.  i.e. jAudioFeatureExtractor.Aggregators.AreaPolynomialApproximation would need to be placed in $plugin$/jAudioFeatureExtractor/Aggregators/AreaPolynomialApproximation.class 
where $plugin$ is the folder specified in the plugin XML entry.  The plugin folder must be a fully qualified URL (HTTP locations permitted) of the syntax:</p>
<p></p>
<p><code>
        &lt;pluginFolder&gt;file://Users/mcennis/jAudio/plugin&lt;/pluginFolder&gt;
</code></p>
