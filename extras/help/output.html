<h2>OutputTypes</h2>
<p>jAudio supports two different output formats.  One is the XML format used by 
ACE.  The other is Weka's ARFF.  While ACE can fully utilize the features given,
ARFF is more limited.  With Weka's ARFF selected only one of "Save Per Window" or
"Save Overall Stats" can be selected.
