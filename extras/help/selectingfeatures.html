<h2>Selecting Features for Analysis</h2>
Features are selected by left clicking on the checkbox immediately to their
right in the feature selection toolbox.  Note that all features can be saved 
independantly. All dependancies are tracked internally so that the system 
tracks what dependancies are needed and silently calculates them without
requiring them to be specifically selected by the user.
