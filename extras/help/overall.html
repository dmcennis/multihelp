<h2>Saving Features For Each Window</h2>
<p>Every time a window is calculated, a set of features is extracted.  If this 
checkbox is selected, the features extracted will be save to a file.  <b>Note</b>
When outputing to Weka's ARFF format, outputing on a window by window basis is mutually 
exclusive with outputing overall statistics.
