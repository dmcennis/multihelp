<h2>Aggregators</h2>
<p>Aggregators are a method from reducing a file's sequence of analysis windows to a single fixed length vector for analysis. 
They are required for per-file feature output, but have built in defaults.
There exists two types of aggregators - specific aggregators and generic aggregators.</p>
 <p>
 Generic aggregators aggregate for each feature (seperately) that is to be
 saved and should override init and setSource methods. Specific aggregators
 can aggregate any number of features, but these features must be specified in
 advance.</p>
<p>Traditionally, aggregators have been the mean and standard deviation of each dimension and each feature, however more sophisticated measures 
can also be useful.</p>
