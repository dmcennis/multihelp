<h2>2D Polynomial Approximation</h2>
<p>This specific aggregator was first released in an August 2010 working paper by Daniel McEnnis.  It transforms
a 2D matrix of signal feature vectors into a set of coeffecients of the polynomial function f(x,y) that bests matches the 
given signal. It is calucalated by constructing a matrix of coeffecients by substituting concrete data points into each
term that coeffecient is attached to (such as x^2*y^3) and a answer matrix is created from the signal at 
that matrix index.  The coeffecients are then calculated by a least squares minimization matrix solver (colt matrix function).</p>
