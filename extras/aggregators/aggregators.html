<h2>Aggregator Appendix</h2>
<p>All available aggregators are listed in the aggregators table (accessible
by the alter aggregators button).  There are two classes of aggregators - general and specific.</p>
<p/>
<h3>General Aggregators</h3>
<p>General aggregators apply to every feature chosen.  As such, they do not need a list of specific features to aggregate.
These aggregators may still have parameters to set, thus editing a aggregator is possible whether or not specific fetaures are set.</p>
<p/>
<h3>Specific Aggregators</h3>
<p>Specific aggregators apply only to a subset of features. These aggregators include a feature selection dialog in the edit
aggregators box.</p>
