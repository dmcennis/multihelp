<h2>Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coeffecients</h2>
<p>First created for the study of speech sounds, it one of the oldest hearing-specific features.
It is designed to exploit 2 properties - human hearing is logarithmic and perception of amplitude is 
logarithmic as well.  Itg is calculated by transforming tothe frequency domain using FFT, binning the FFT bins into
logarithmic bins, performing a log transform of each signal, then transforming back into the signal domain with an inverse FFT,
falsely assuming the signal is a linear rather than logarithmic bins.</p>
