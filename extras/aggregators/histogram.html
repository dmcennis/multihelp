<h2>Histogram Binning</h2>
<p>This specific algorithm correlates different feature dimensions provided, binning them
into equal bins relative to each feature's range. The resulting feature set, similar to the 
area method of moments, captures cross-feature information.  However, this feature uses an extremely
large feature set that grows exponentially with the number of features added.  On the positive side, the order
of the features is irrelevant to its performance.

<h2>Histogram Binning History</h2>
<p>First used in 2000, it was not formally published until McEnnis and Fujinaga 2005.</p>
