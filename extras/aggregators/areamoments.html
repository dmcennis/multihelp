<h2>Area Method of Moments Aggregator</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Algorithm Description</h3>
<p>This specific aggregator was originally intended to be the first 10 statistical moments of a 2D area. 
This algorithm was first used in graphic machine learning by Fujinaga in 1998.  Its first use in digital
signal processing is in McEnnis and Fujinaga 2005.
<p>It is a specific feature as the effectiveness of the resulting features is heavily dependent on the importance of the feature ordering.
</p>
<h3>Algorithm History</h3>
<p>The algorithm treats the image as a 2D function f(x,y) = z where x and y are indecis of the underlying matrix.
The order of x and y is increased together from order 0 to order 3, caluclated with a coeefcient calculated by the binomial 
of the x and y order.</p>
<p>The original DSP version is a collaborative effort between the author of the code and Ichiro Fujinaga.
