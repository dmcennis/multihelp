<h2>Spectral Centroid</h2>
A feature extractor that extracts the Spectral Cecntroid. This is a measure
of the "centre of mass" of the power spectrum.

<p>This is calculated by calculating the mean bin of the power spectrum. The
result returned is a number from 0 to 1 that represents at what fraction of
the total number of bins this central frequency is.
