<h2>Feature Appendix</h2>
<p>All available features are listed in the features table (on the
right panel).  There are two classes of features. One is primary
features.  The other is derived features.
<p>
<h3>Primary Features</h3>
<p>These features are defined directly in the system.  To emphasize
the greater importance of these features relative to their derived
counterparts, primary features are displayed in bold.  Only primary
features are selected by default.
<p>
<h3>Derived Features</h3>
<p>In addition to primary features there are derived features.  These
features are created by applying metafeatures to primary features.  All
of these features include the name of the feature they are derived from.
While potentially, useful, none of these features are selected by default.
In the default order, derived features are presented immediately after
the primary feature they are derived from.
