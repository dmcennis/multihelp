	histogram showing the strength of different rhythmic periodicities in a
	signal. 
	<p>

	the FFT of the result.

	<b>IMPORTANT:
	 The window size of 256 RMS windows used here is hard-coded into the class
	 BeatHistogramLabels. Any changes to the window size in this class must be
	 made there as well.</b>
