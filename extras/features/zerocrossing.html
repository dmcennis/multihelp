<h2>Zero Crossings</h2>
A feature extractor that extracts the Zero Crossings from a set of
samples. This is a good measure of the pitch as well as the noisiness
of a signal.

<p>Zero crossings are calculated by finding the number of times the signal
changes sign from one sample to another (or touches the zero axis).
