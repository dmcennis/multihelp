	<h2>Constant Q MFCC's</h2>
	<p>This feature implements an alternative to the MFCC that directly calculates the
	logarithmic frequency bins rather than performing an FFT and rebinning the content.</p>
	<p>As a consequence, the number of MFCCs are the maximum number containing information by default 
	while the width of the logarithmic bins are a parameter (alpha).</p>
