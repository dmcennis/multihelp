<title>2D Polynomial Approximation of Log Constant Q</title>

	<h2>2D Polynomial Approximation</h2>
	<p>2D Polynomial approximation creates a f(x,y)=z polynomial that bests fits the 
	given data points.  By default, all data points are included, but theoretically,
	complete data is not a requirement.  The result comes from a coeffecient matrix created by 
	calculating the given powers of x and y from indeci data for each coeffecient term, 
	then calculating the least square error while generating an output vector.  This
	variant utilizes the logarithm of constant Q bins for the vertical dimension.</p>
