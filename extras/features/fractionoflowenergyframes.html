<h2>Fraction of Low Energy Frames</h2>

A feature extractor that extracts the Fraction Of Low Energy Windows from
window to window. This is a good measure of how much of a signal is quiet
relative to the rest of a signal. 
<p>
This is calculated by taking the mean of
the RMS of the last 100 windows and finding what fraction of these 100
windows are below the mean.
