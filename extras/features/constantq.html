	<h2>Constant Q Feature</h2>
	<p>This feature implements an alternative to the FFT.  Instead of linear bins, it creates logarithmic frequency bins
	using alpha as a parameter representing the number of semitones (2^1/12) per bin.
	While its use in MIR is recent, it is an old DSP feature, created during the period where FFT's required custom hardware 
	to compute.</p>
