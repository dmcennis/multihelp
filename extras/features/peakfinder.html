<h2>Peak Detector</h2>
Implements a very basic peak detection algorithm. Peaks are calculated by
finding local maximum in the values of the frequency bins. All maxima within
a threshold of the largest value is considered a peak. The thresholds of all
peaks are provided in order without its bin location in the original signal.
