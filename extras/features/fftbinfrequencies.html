<h2>FFT Bin Frequency Labels</h2>
A "feature extractor" that calculates the bin labels, in Hz, of power spectrum
or magnitude spectrum bins that would be produced by the FFT of a window of the
size of that provided to the feature extractor.

<p>Although this is not a useful feature for the purposes of classifying,
it can be useful for calculating other features.
