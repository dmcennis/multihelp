<h2>Beat Histogram Bin Labels</h2>
A "feature extractor" that calculates the bin labels, in beats per minute, of 
a beat histogram.
<p>
Although this is not a useful feature for the purposes of classifying,
it can be useful for calculating other features.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</P> 
The window size of 256 RMS windows used in the 
BeatHistogram is hard-coded into this class. Any changes to the value
in that class must be made here as well.
