	<h2>Area Method of Moments Feature</h2>
	This class implements 2D statistical methods of moments as implemented by
	Fujinaga (1997). The number of consectuive windows that one can edit accross
	is an editable property. Furthermore, this classes window property is
	affected by global window size changes. This variant utilizes  
	MFCC's instead of FFT bins for the vertical dimension.
