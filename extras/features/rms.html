<h2>RMS</h2>
A feature extractor that extracts the Root Mean Square (RMS) from a set of
samples. This is a good measure of the power of a signal.

<p>RMS is calculated by summing the squares of each sample, dividing this
by the number of samples in the window, and finding the square root of the
result.
